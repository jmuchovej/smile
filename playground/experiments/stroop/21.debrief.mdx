# Congratulations! You've Completed the Stroop Task! <‰

Thank you for participating in this classic cognitive psychology experiment. Your data will help us better understand how the brain processes conflicting information.

## What You Just Experienced

The **Stroop Effect** is one of the most famous phenomena in psychology, discovered by John Ridley Stroop in 1935. You probably noticed that:

- **Easy trials**: When the word and color matched (like "BLUE" in blue text), you responded quickly
- **Hard trials**: When they didn't match (like "RED" in green text), it took more effort and time

This happens because reading is such an automatic process that your brain reads the word even when you're trying to focus on the color!

## Why This Matters

Your performance in this task tells us about:

- **Cognitive Control**: Your ability to focus on relevant information while ignoring distractions
- **Automatic vs. Controlled Processing**: How your brain handles conflicting automatic responses
- **Individual Differences**: How cognitive control varies between people

This research contributes to our understanding of:
- Attention and focus
- Cognitive aging
- Neurological conditions
- Educational interventions

## Your Performance

- **Total trials completed**: You saw various color-word combinations
- **Reaction times**: Measured how quickly you responded to each stimulus
- **Accuracy**: Tracked how well you identified colors vs. reading words

Don't worry if you made mistakes or felt some trials were challenging - that's completely normal and expected!

## What Happens Next

Your anonymous data will be:
- Combined with other participants' data
- Analyzed to understand patterns in cognitive control
- Used to contribute to scientific knowledge about human cognition
- Potentially published in research papers (completely anonymously)

## Thank You!

Your participation in psychological research helps us understand the human mind better. Every response you made contributes to our knowledge of how cognition works.

If you have any questions about this study or your participation, please don't hesitate to contact the research team.

**Thank you for your time and contribution to science!** >à(
