title: The Stroop Color-Word Task
---

# Welcome to the Stroop Task!

In this experiment, you'll see color words displayed on the screen. Your task is simple:

**Identify the COLOR of the text, not what the word says.**

## What You'll Do

You'll see words like "RED", "GREEN", or "BLUE" displayed in different colors. Your job is to:

1. **Look at the color** of the text (ignore what the word says)
2. **Press the corresponding key**:
   - Press **R** for red text
   - Press **G** for green text  
   - Press **B** for blue text

## Example

If you see the word "BLUE" written in <span style="color: red">red text</span>, you would press **R** because the text is red.

## Why This Matters

This classic psychology task helps us understand how your brain processes conflicting information. Sometimes the word and color match (easy!), and sometimes they don't (tricky!).
