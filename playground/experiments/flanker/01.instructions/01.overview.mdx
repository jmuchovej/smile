title: The Flanker Arrow Task
---

# Welcome to the Flanker Task!

In this experiment, you'll test your ability to focus on important information while ignoring distractions. Your task is:

**Look at the CENTER arrow and press the key that matches its direction, ignoring the surrounding arrows.**

## What You'll See

You'll see patterns of arrows like these:

### Easy Trials (All arrows point the same way)
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 48px; font-family: monospace; margin: 20px 0;">
  → → → → →
</div>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 48px; font-family: monospace; margin: 20px 0;">
  ← ← ← ← ←
</div>

### Hard Trials (Center arrow differs from the sides)
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 48px; font-family: monospace; margin: 20px 0;">
  ← ← → ← ←
</div>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 48px; font-family: monospace; margin: 20px 0;">
  → → ← → →
</div>

## Your Job

- **Focus on the CENTER arrow only**
- **Press `A`** if the center arrow points left (←)
- **Press `L`** if the center arrow points right (→)
- **Ignore the flanking arrows** - they're just distractions!

## Why This Matters

This classic psychology task measures **selective attention** - your brain's ability to focus on relevant information while filtering out distractions. It's a fundamental cognitive skill we use every day!
