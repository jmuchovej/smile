# Mastering the Flanker Task

Here are some strategies to help you perform your best:

## Hand Position

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0; padding: 20px; background: #eff6ff; border-radius: 10px; border: 2px solid #2563eb;">
  <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Position your fingers over the `A` and `L` keys</strong></p>
  <p style="color: #6b7280;">Keep them ready to press quickly</p>
</div>

## Visual Strategy

### Focus Technique
1. **Fix your gaze** on the center of the screen
2. **Use peripheral vision** - don't look directly at the flankers
3. **Trust your first instinct** about the center arrow's direction
4. **Don't overthink** - your brain processes this automatically

## What to Expect

### Three Types of Trials:

**üü¢ Congruent (Easy)**: All arrows point the same way
- These feel natural and fast
- About 1/3 of trials

**üî¥ Incongruent (Hard)**: Center arrow differs from flankers
- These require more concentration
- You might feel "pulled" toward the wrong response
- About 1/3 of trials

**üü° Neutral**: Flankers are dashes or lines
- No conflicting information
- About 1/3 of trials

## Common Challenges

‚ö†Ô∏è **The "Flanker Effect"**: You might find incongruent trials slower and more error-prone. This is completely normal - it's exactly what the experiment measures!

‚ö†Ô∏è **Speed vs. Accuracy**: Try to balance both. It's better to be slightly slower and correct than to rush and make mistakes.

## Mental Preparation

- **Stay relaxed** - tension makes it harder to focus
- **Keep breathing normally** - don't hold your breath during trials
- **Reset after mistakes** - everyone makes some errors

**Ready for a quick understanding check?**
