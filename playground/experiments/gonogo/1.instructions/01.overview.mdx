title: The Go/No-Go Task

# Welcome to the Go/No-Go Task!

In this experiment, you'll test your ability to control your responses. Your task is:

**Press SPACEBAR quickly for "Go" letters, but STOP yourself from pressing anything for "No-Go" letters.**

## What You'll See

You'll see letters appear one at a time in the center of the screen. There are two types:

### Go Letters (Press SPACEBAR)
- **Press SPACEBAR** as quickly as possible when you see these letters
- These are your "target" letters - respond fast!

### No-Go Letters (DON'T Press Anything)
- **DON'T press anything** when you see these letters
- Hold back your response - stay still!

## The Challenge

This task tests **response inhibition** - your brain's ability to stop an action that's already started. Most letters will be "Go" letters, so your brain gets ready to press the spacebar. The challenge is stopping yourself when a "No-Go" letter appears!

## Why This Matters

This classic psychology task helps us understand:
- **Self-control**: How well you can stop automatic responses
- **Attention**: How focused you can stay during repetitive tasks
- **Impulse control**: Your ability to resist acting when you shouldn't
