# Strategy for Success

Here are some tips to help you perform your best:

## Hand Position

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0; padding: 20px; background: #eff6ff; border-radius: 10px; border: 2px solid #2563eb;">
  <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Position your thumb over the SPACEBAR</strong></p>
  <p style="color: #6b7280;">Keep it hovering and ready to press quickly</p>
</div>

## Mental Strategy

### For Go Letters:
1. **React quickly** - don't overthink it
2. **Trust your instincts** - press as soon as you see the Go letter
3. **Stay alert** - be ready for the next letter

### For No-Go Letters:
1. **Stay calm** - resist the urge to press
2. **Don't tense up** - relaxed alertness works best
3. **Reset quickly** - get ready for the next Go letter

## What to Expect

- **Letters appear briefly** - usually for about 1 second
- **Short breaks** between each letter
- **Mix of Go and No-Go** - stay on your toes!
- **It gets tricky** - your brain wants to press automatically

## Common Challenges

⚠️ **"I pressed when I shouldn't have!"**
- This is totally normal! No-Go letters are designed to trick your automatic responses
- Don't worry about mistakes - just refocus for the next letter

⚠️ **"I was too slow on Go letters!"**
- Speed comes with practice - try to respond within 500ms if possible
- Better to be a little slower than to miss responding entirely
