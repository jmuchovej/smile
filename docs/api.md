# Smile API

Smile provides a common API which is accessed in user [Views](./views.md) and
[Components](./components.md). This API provides a set of methods and properties
which enable things like navigation, state management, data access, and more.

## Usage

The Smile API is typically accessed through the `useViewAPI` composable, which
extends the base `useAPI` with additional functionality for interacting with the
stepper and handling user input events:

```js
// import and initialize view API (recommended)
import useViewAPI from "@/core/composables/useViewAPI";
const api = useViewAPI();

// or import and initialize base API only
import useAPI from "@/core/composables/useAPI";
const api = useAPI();
```

The `useViewAPI` composable provides all the functionality of `useAPI` plus
additional methods for:

- Stepper control and data management
- Keyboard event handling
- Mouse event handling
- Step data recording
- Timing utilities
- State visualization

## Stepper Functions

The following functions are available when using `useViewAPI`:

### Navigation

- `goNextStep()`: Advances to the next step in the stepper.
- `goPrevStep()`: Returns to the previous step in the stepper.
- `goToStep(path)`: Navigates to a specific step by path.
- `goFirstStep()`: Resets the stepper to its first step.
- `hasNextStep()`: Checks if there's a next step available.
- `hasPrevStep()`: Checks if there's a previous step available.
- `hasSteps()`: Checks if the stepper has any steps.

### Data Access

- `stepData`: Getter/setter for the current step's data. This is a proxy that
  allows you to get and set values on the current step's data. Changes are
  automatically saved to the stepper state.
- `stepDataLeaf`: Getter/setter for the current leaf node's data only. Similar
  to `stepData` but only includes data from the current leaf node, not the
  entire path. This is useful when you want to work with just the current step's
  data without including parent block data.
- `queryStepData`, `queryStepDataLeaf`: See
  [Data Query Methods](#data-query-methods).
- `pathData`: Getter for the raw data array of all steps in the current path.
  This is useful when you need to access the raw data structure of the path.
- `pathData`: Returns the current data path with component resolution.
- `stepIndex`: Returns the current step index among leaf nodes.
- `blockIndex`: Returns the current block index.
- `pathString`: Returns the current path as a string.
- `path`: Returns the current path array.
- `length`: Returns the number of steps.
- `nSteps`: Alias for `length`.
- `blockLength`: Returns the number of steps in the current block.
- `stepLength`: Returns the total number of leaf nodes.
- `isLastStep()`: Returns true if the current step is the last step in the
  sequence.
- `isLastBlockStep()`: Returns true if the current step is the last step in the
  current block.
- `steps`: Provides direct access to the underlying Stepper state machine
  instance.

### Timing

- `startTimer(name = 'default')`: Starts a timer with the given name.
- `isTimerStarted(name = 'default')`: Checks if a timer has been started.
- `elapsedTime(name = 'default')`: Returns elapsed time in milliseconds.
- `elapsedTimeInSeconds(name = 'default')`: Returns elapsed time in seconds.

- `clearCurrentStepData()`: Clears the data for the current step in the stepper.
  filtered by path pattern.
- `updateStepper()`: Updates the internal stepper state.
- `_visualizeStateMachine()`: Returns a visualization of the current state
  machine.

### Event Handling

- `onKeyDown`: Handler for key down events.
- `onKeyPressed`: Handler for key press events.

## State Management

- `resetLocalState()`: Clears all locally stored data, and redirects to the
  landing page.
- `resetApp()`: Resets the entire application state.
- `isResetApp()`: Checks if the app has been reset.
- `resetStore()`: Resets just the store state.
- `setKnown()`: Marks the user as known (has begun the experiment).
- `setDone()`: Marks the experiment as done.
- `setConsented()`: Marks that the user has consented.
- `setWithdrawn(forminfo)`: Marks that the user has withdrawn and saves
  information from withdrawal form.

## Randomization Functions

- `randomSeed(seed = uuidv4())`: Sets a new global random seed that will remain
  in use until the next route.
- `randomAssignCondition(conditionObject)`: Randomly assigns a condition based
  on the provided condition object. Supports weighted randomization.
- `shuffle(options)`: Shuffles the current states using the Fisher-Yates
  algorithm. If a seed is provided, ensures deterministic shuffling.

**Parameters:**

- `options` (Object|string): Either a string seed or an options object
  - `seed` (string, optional): Seed for deterministic shuffling
  - `always` (boolean, optional): If true, allows shuffling even if already
    shuffled. Defaults to false.

**Returns:**

- Returns the Stepper instance for method chaining

**Example:**

```javascript
// Shuffle with a seed (only shuffles if not already shuffled)
stepper.shuffle("seed123");

// Shuffle with options
stepper.shuffle({ seed: "seed123", always: false }); // Only shuffles if not already shuffled
stepper.shuffle({ seed: "seed123", always: true }); // Always shuffles
stepper.shuffle({ always: true }); // Always shuffles without a seed
```

**Notes:**

- The shuffle operation is tracked internally. Once shuffled, subsequent calls
  to shuffle will be ignored unless `always` is set to true.
- If there is only one or zero states, the shuffle operation is skipped.

## Logging and Debugging

- `log.debug(...message)`: Logs a debug message.
- `log.log(...message)`: Logs a standard message.
- `log.warn(...message)`: Logs a warning message.
- `log.error(...message)`: Logs an error message.
- `log.success(...message)`: Logs a success message.
- `log.clearPageHistory()`: Clears the page history log.
- `log.addToHistory(...args)`: Adds an entry to the page history log.

## Data Recording and Saving

The following methods are used to record and save data in the experiment. Note
that Firestore has limitations on the types of data it can store directly. When
using these methods, ensure your data objects are Firestore-safe:

- Only primitive types (string, number, boolean, null)
- Arrays of primitive types
- Objects containing only primitive types
- Timestamps
- References to other documents
- GeoPoints

Complex JavaScript objects (like functions, classes, or objects with circular
references) must be converted to Firestore-safe formats before saving.

- `recordForm(name, myFirestoreSafeObject)`: Saves form data for any arbitrarily
  named form (see [DemographicSurvey](views#demographic-survey) for an example).
  The object must be Firestore-safe.
- `recordProperty(name, FirestoreSafeObject)`: Saves a Firestore-safe object at
  the top level of the data object. This does not save the data to the database,
  but it does record it in the local state. The next call to `saveData()` will
  save the data to the database.
- `recordStep()`: Records the current step in the stepper. This does not save
  the data to the database, but it does record it in the local state. The next
  call to `saveData()` will save the data to the database.
- `recordData(myFirestoreSafeObject)`: Records a Firestore-safe object in the
  trials. This does not save the data to the database, but it does record it in
  the local state. The next call to `saveData()` will save the data to the
  database.
- `recordWindowEvent(type, event_data = null)`: Records a window event. The
  event_data must be Firestore-safe if provided.
- `saveData(force)`: Saves the current data to the database (force save if
  specified). All data must be Firestore-safe.

### Data Query Methods

These methods provide functionality for querying data across multiple steps in
the experiment.

#### `queryStepData(pathFilter = null)`

Gets data for all leaf nodes in the stepper, optionally filtered by path
pattern. Returns only the data directly associated with each leaf node, without
merging parent block data.

```javascript
// Get data for all leaf nodes
const allLeafData = api.queryStepData();

// Get data for nodes matching a pattern
const trialData = api.queryStepData("trial/block*");
```

#### `queryStepDataLeaf(pathFilter = null)`

Gets data for all leaf nodes in the stepper, optionally filtered by path
pattern. Returns only the data directly associated with each leaf node, without
merging parent block data. This is an alias for `queryStepData` for consistency
with the `stepDataLeaf` getter.

```javascript
// Get data for all leaf nodes
const allLeafData = api.queryStepDataLeaf();

// Get data for nodes matching a pattern
const trialData = api.queryStepDataLeaf("trial/block*");
```

#### `queryStepDataMerge(pathFilter = null)`

Gets merged data for all leaf nodes in the stepper, optionally filtered by path
pattern. Similar to `queryStepData` but returns the merged data for each leaf
node (including parent block data).

```javascript
// Get merged data for all leaf nodes
const allMergedData = api.queryStepDataMerge();

// Get merged data for nodes matching a pattern
const trialData = api.queryStepDataMerge("trial/block*");
```

The difference between these methods can be illustrated with an example:

```javascript
// Given a structure:
// block (blockType: 'practice')
//   trial1 (response: 'A')
//   trial2 (response: 'B')

// queryStepData() returns:
[{ response: "A" }, { response: "B" }][
  // queryStepDataMerge() returns:
  ({ blockType: "practice", response: "A" }, { blockType: "practice", response: "B" })
];
```
